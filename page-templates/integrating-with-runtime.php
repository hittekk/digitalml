					<p>Enterprises support distributed runtime environments and ignite integrates with them, focusing on the Plan, Design, and Build stages.</p>
					
					<p>Design how your business needs to be - not how it is now.  Abstract business and technical functions into designs, generate APIs and services to support these functions, and implement them for platform specific needs or environments, and widen the audience for APIs to all those involved in the digital business.</p>
