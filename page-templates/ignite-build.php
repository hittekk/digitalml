ignite lets developers assemble products using core building blocks. These abstracted blocks have already been aligned to data model and taxonomy. They all talk the way the business talks. They’re mapped to stakeholders systems, so flow and lineage is clearly visible. The impact of change is apparent and changes can be made earlier in the design lifecycle, when they’re much cheaper. They’re ready to be plugged into for innovation, so developers can focus their skills on delivering products, not just another API.

			<h1>How to Build Fast</h1>
Because ignite enables you to plan and design consistent, appealing, reliable, and world-class products, the Build process becomes significantly quicker -- in one customer’s words, “a dream state.”
<br><br>
<h3>Automate Repeatable Processes</h3>
IT managers know that great developers are a scarce resource. A rockstar developer might create elegant designs by hand, but can probably only build ten APIs a year, by the time mappings are made and all requirements are gathered. If your enterprise needs 400-2,000 microservices to digitize their core business functions, even a staff of 10 great developers with take 8-10 years to build out digital capacity. But when ignite users can define their output templates and create customized guides to speed implementation, when everything that comes out of ignite is aligned to the company’s architecture, development, and design standards -- that same staff can do the job in a quarter of the time, freeing them up to help innovate against an ever-changing business landscape.
<br><br>
<h3>Build for Consistency, Reuse, & Alignment</h3>
With ignite, innovation simply requires developers to borrow a building block from one core area, fit it to other core building blocks, build out the gaps, add implementation code, and launch — while avoiding the duplication and bottlenecks that often plague API development. When developers assemble products using core building blocks, abstracted and aligned to your data model and taxonomy, those products all talk the way business talks. They're mapped to stakeholders systems, so flow and lineage are clearly visible, the impact of change is apparent, and changes can be made earlier in the Design lifecycle, when they're far cheaper.
<br><br>
<h3>Run a Tight (Audit-Ready) Ship</h3>
We provide source code management for APIs that carry their own metadata. This level of governance not only works to ensure everything is running directly on your company’s living canonical model; it also keeps track of ownership, version control, and source code management along every lifecycle step, providing an extra level of governance. With the developer workbench, getting under the hood is always an option, but for the sake of time and security clearance, our customers prefer the drop-down menus to ensure the correct security and compliance is implemented. This means the right information is always captured, the right processes, baked-in -- so when it comes time for the big audit, there's no need to shut down several departments.
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
Because our platform is design-first, the Build stage is ignite's fastest. It is usually a matter of review-and-click -- from there, your code templates are automated from the presets you've designed.
<br><br>
<h3>From Design to Code Template</h3>
Equipped with a clearly visible portfolio of core API building blocks which provide the interface, boilerplate code, domain-based mappings, and test conditions, the design is so comprehensive, developers often don’t have to waste much time tweaking in the Build phase at all -- updates made in the design phase can be pushed directly to code template, whatever the form (REST, SOAP, etc.) freeing up your biggest brians for business logic. 
<br><br>
<h3>Service Contracts - REST, SOAP, Event, & More</h3>
Because ignite helps accurately describe data model and taxonomy specifications, developers gain the deep flexibility so critical in multiple environments and technology frameworks. They can choose the most efficient and convenient execution environment and implementation language. They can support REST, SOAP web services,  event messages, or whatever comes next -- with ignite, the process of building digital products accelerates even while you strengthen the consistency and dependability of those products.
<br><br>
<h3>Continuous Delivery & Integration</h3>
Future technology needs will demand even more flexibility. IoT (The Internet of Things) and connected devices will all be linked through APIs. Big Data requires analytics, which require unimpeded flow of information. Virtual Reality and augmented reality may play roles not yet understood. Your IT must allow such implementations to run smoothly without major infrastructure investments.
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>Developers Freed up for Business Logic</h1>
Developers love ignite, because they are able to finally get ahead of their heavy launch schedules. And our baked-in dashboard reporting makes it easy for them to see how their creations stack up. By abstracting Design from the specifics of each use-case, ignite supercharges your IT teams, freeing their minds to focus on business logic, implementation, user experience, back-end connections, and all the big-brain thinking that optimizes their skill sets.

		ignite offers the advantage of quickly launching new products and iterating them without breaking anything up in production.
		<br><br>
For instance, let’s say your enterprise is funding a project that exposes 10 billing fields from one application to another. And then a separate project is funded, requiring 15 fields from that same application to be exposed. This can happen over and over in a large enterprise, where digital products are often built on a use-case basis — whether to meet regional systems or to provide configuration code for iPhone management or other specific platforms.
<br><br>
ignite lets developers assemble products using core building blocks. These ab- stracted blocks have already been aligned to data model and taxonomy. They all talk the way the business talks. They’re mapped to stakeholders systems, so flow and lineage are clearly visible. The impact of change is apparent and changes can be made earlier in the design lifecycle, when they’re much cheaper.
<br><br>
ignite allows IT to build the core billing API, expose that core business functionality, then pass over a building block to developers, who plug in regional back ends or write extensions for a specific platform or mobile experience.
Similarly, ignite allows enterprises to build APIs for internal consumption, but build them like they’re going to be exposing key business entities. Then business leaders can decide which ones they expose externally. With properly built, reliable, scalable API products, technology is not the limiting factor in determining which products are made public.
