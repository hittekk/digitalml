<h1>Why Design-First?</h1>
Business has ideas; IT has the capabilities to launch them. Until now, when it came to API development, most enterprises leapt from ideation to build. They skipped the Design stage and went straight to Create. They also skipped millions of dollars in savings and countless development hours that could have been spent on user experience or business logic. 
<br><br>
<h3>Design Unlocks Reuse</h3>
You can capture detailed information in your API specification and expose reusable design artifacts, like your Items API — made up of consistent Product ID, Description, Price, Weight, and whatever else is critical to your business functions — to be used in every API that involves Items. You can design your Payment API comprised of Standard Payment, Bill Pay, Wallet Management and B2B Pay code, for any APIs in any Line of Business (LOB) that requires Payments. 
<br><br>
<h3>Governance to Build With Speed & Control</h3>
The ignite Design phase equips you to design core functions for the business, not by use-case. With the broader design capability of ignite, you gain configurable, self-service governance. Through governance, you automate repeatable patterns (like mapping) -- and you gain speed <i>with</i> control. In other words, design-first means it's possible have your cake and eat it, too.
<br><br>
For most industries, security and compliance are of utmost importance, yet often a bottleneck for the speed of delivery. Keeping up with requirements that come in the form of spreadsheets, Word docs, Confluence files and wikis leaves a lot of room for human error. ignite maps requirements and metadata directly to the services you’re building with, eliminating human error and speeding production to a transcendent state.
<br><br>
<h3>Agility & Scale</h3>
Designing a clearly visible API Catalog in ignite also helps enterprises prepare for agility in the face of emerging technologies. With the rise of Big Data, analytics, and IoT, the eventual aim is to bring all of this information under one roof. Stakeholder systems (the system-of-record mapping to API definitions) aligned to data-in-motion (your API Products, web services, and events) allows you to assess and assimilate all of the company’s operations in real-time, prioritizing clarity for roadmap initiatives and allowing you to implement changes before the hurdles ever affect sales.
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
There are two ways to visit the Design stage within the ignite Platform.
<br><br>
<h3>1. Create New</h3>
With this functionality, you are taking your chosen API Collection and adding elements to it to make it a true API Product. All of your Business Capability Building Blocks and existing API Products are automatically mapped to your living canonical model (we call this the "domain-based information model"), so that you don't have to rewrite the book -- you can reuse, simplify, or augment the definitions, specification, flow of actions, associated Business Glossary terms, etc. But most importantly, you're not wasting time creating what someone else has already created. Or mapping from spreadsheets.
<br><br>
<h3>2. Extend Existing</h3>
To extend an existing service, you need only make adjustments and publish -- no need to worry about breaking other services in production. Change management is logged, you can always access previous versions should the need arise, and as soon as you submit, the changes are pushed out live through ignite or ignite's connection to your runtime editor.
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>The Enterprise API Strategy</h1>
The average large enterprise needs about 400-2,000 APIs to transform their core business functions to digital experiences. It’s a mistake to place the burden of all of those APIs directly on developers without designing an overall vision of how those APIs should interact and help business innovate.
<br><br>
Within ignite you’ll design common building block APIs in the language of the business, with consistent resources from data and taxonomy models, standardized API definitions and system of record mapping -- all under one domain-based information model, so that systems can align globally and updates to the model can be pushed out without breaking the services in production.

			By emphasizing Design, ignite optimizes the Build and Run phases. Because you’re delivering reliable,
standardized design artifacts to developers, they can rapidly assemble new APIs and simply plug in back-end functionality or write configuration code to run the product.<br><br>

		<img src="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/images/ignite/design-img2.png" class="img-responsive" ><br><br>
		ignite offers the advantage of quickly launching new products and iterating them without breaking anything up in production.
		<br><br>
For instance, for major retailers, Buy Online, Pick Up in Store is a great digital service. But what if a retailer in the middle of building that program decides to add an inventory availability function and a location-based loyalty offering? By simply re-combining prebuilt APIs that identify item number and description, inventory availability, customer location and store ID, a new service can be quickly built on top of the emerging product with no interruption in production.
<br><br>
And the retailer can keep innovating. If they want to provide 7-10 core business functions for an end-to-end digital & physical experience, there are a lot more ideas that need to be supported by great API Products.
