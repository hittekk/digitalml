						<p>The ignite platform provides a holistic service catalog as well as an end-to-end lifecycle with a focus on plan, design, and build, generating most of the required code and gateway settings directly to your CI/CD and run. With proven success, our customers use ignite to build and manage a catalog and the lifecyle of APIs and Microservices (+SOAP and composite services, business capabilities, glossaries, information models, mappings, metadata, building block code, and documentation) - and deploy the artifacts to their implementation platforms of choice. This allows you to digital transform as well as modernize your IT - fast.</p>
