<h1>Why API Product Management?</h1>
As more of the leading enterprises move to straddle digital and brick and mortar, it is becoming clear that we must give our digital products the same attention and governance as we do our physical products. And with the change in strategy comes a change in mindset: no longer is digital the sole responsibility of IT. If digital product strategies are to succeed, the modern enterprise must involve both, business and IT, in the model.
<br><br>
<h3>API Catalog</h3>
Imagine a place where Business and IT can meet over one repository of your entire enterprise's core functions, digitized as API building blocks and ready to plug in and go. Your API Catalog is essentially an innovation lab where you can browse different views of your entire catalog of owned and governed API Products and Business Capability Building Blocks, as well as Third Party APIs, to extend extra functionality. Your catalog includes a Business Glossary to translate existing projects at a global scale for discoverability, and automated mappings via the living canonical we call a "domain-based information model," so that you can reuse and augment as you build, without having to worry about breaking the systems in place.
<br><br>
Once you have your API Catalog of core capabilities, designing new services is a matter of self-serviceable search-and-discover. Combine your API Products, Business Capability Building Blocks, and Third-Party APIs, grouping in exciting new ways for an ideal state of innovation accessible to both, Business and IT.
<br><br>
<h3>API Products</h3>
API Products are the key to digital market leadership. By exposing core functions and data in the form of APIs managed like Products, you unlock internal alignment through organized, accessible data structure, the end-to-end story of your full product range for rapid prototyping, and a searchable repository of building blocks for lightning-speed scale.
<br><br>
<h3>Business Capability Building Blocks</h3>
The average enterprise needs between 400-2,000 API Products to power core functions. ignite enables you to build these as self-contained, reliable, and easily-repeatable blocks tied to an enterprise-wide information model. Because these building blocks are designed with consistent data and taxonomy references, you’re able to eliminate redundancies, automate manual reviews, and speed time to market signiﬁcantly by eliminating reams of handwritten code. 
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>Implementation</h1>
There are four ways to implement the Plan stage within the ignite Platform. 
<br><br>
<h3>1. Search, Discover, Innovate</h3>
With all of your core functions exposed as APIs right next to your best digital experiences and the 3rd parties that can extend them to local relevance, your chances for disruption are at an all-time high -- so let the ideation begin.
<br><br>
With ignite, when a business leader has an idea, instead of assembling a project Use Case document and asking a developer to handcraft new code to bring new APIs to life, he or she can access an easy-to-surf repository that displays which APIs the enterprise already has, what they are capable of, what new APIs the idea will require, how much it will cost to build new assets, and how quickly the product can be developed and brought to market. 
<br><br>
<h3>2. Agile Portfolio Planning: Prioritize & Collaborate</h3>
What sets ignite apart is broad visibility and continuous integration of your API Catalog from the beginning of the process through runtime. Using ignite, you start product planning with a holistic view of every API that supports your core digital functions. Anybody in business or IT can search and discover which API Products already exist and what their functionality is, analyze the gaps between what you have and what you need to bring a product to market, and partner with IT to streamline the process. 
<br><br>
<h3>3. Agile Product & Team Planning</h3>
ignite empowers rapid innovation, starting with API planning. Most enterprises develop APIs on an ad hoc, per-project basis. But this results in dozens of bespoke APIs, comprised of baffling mazes of code and layers of overlapping functionality. Such redundancies hobble the fleet, nimble launching of new products. 
<br><br>
ignite allows projects to be prioritized according to what's most efficient and quickest to market so that owner & Agile teams can Plan, Design, Build, & Deliver API Products that enable core business functions to interact with third parties. Within ignite, your teams can plan out your portfolio delivery schedule or for a specific product, breaking the production schedule right down to its PI (Planning Increments), which ignite can connect to directly through Jira or your team planner.
<br><br>
<h3>4. Reporting: Expected vs. Actual KPIs</h3>
The ignite Plan phase uniquely integrates with run vendors to pull in product performance and align it to expected Plan and Design performance. This allows you to develop Expected KPIs and compare them to actual performance of your products in the market in real time. 
<br><br><br><br>
<h1>The Journey Begins: Foundation Pack or Import Legacy</h1>
ignite is the only solution that allows your enterprise to leverage legacy by importing your existing assets, converting them to modular API Products, and building out your API Catalog upon those tried-and-true systems that put your company at the top in the first place. For those who would rather hit the ground running, our Foundation Packs let you start building with a catalog full of API Products and building blocks speciﬁc to your industry, including a business glossary and domain-based information model, business taxonomy model, and sample third-party APIs.

			ignite’s dashboard visibility arms Business with a heat map of assets and a clearer understanding of gaps, which informs better investment decisions. Projects can be prioritized according to what's most efficient and quickest to market. Big projects are made manageable when you can expose existing assets and arm developers with foundational building blocks.<br><br>

		Say you’re planning to acquire another large company, one characterized by multiple billings systems. You want to streamline eight billing systems to two.
<br><br>
With ignite, you can quickly expose your core building blocks, aligned to business functions, to the acquired systems while making informed decisions about how long it will take to integrate the new business’ core systems and which are redundant and easily collapsible — and you can drastically reduce costs and time spent doing so.

		Say you’re a large insurance company on the auto insurance market that has developed an easy-claim mobile app for customers who have experienced an auto accident — and that app includes the ability to rent a car from a vendor through your platform. Say a second rental car vendor comes and requests to be part of your service. Because you have exposed core APIs used to bui7ld the first app, reusing those building blocks with a back-end plug-in to the new vendor lets you quickly adapt to that request.
<br><br>
But what if the world changes and customers don’t want to rent cars anymore? What if research indicates that customers would rather access a ride-sharing service. Again, ignite allows you to quickly compare the KPIs of your rent-a-car app, see diminishing performance, and adjust to the new reality quickly by using the same building blocks to create a ride-share request that plugs into Uber APIs for rapid functionality — all while keeping the customer in your app.
